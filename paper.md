# Summary
WDProp provides a visual interface to understanding and improving multilingual and collaborative ontology development on Wikidata.  
Its goal is to understand different aspects of Wikidata properties, particularly focusing on the  translation process.
Every property has three major information that requires to be translated: label, description and aliases.
A property may have none, some or all of these information in any given language.
Properties can be therefore be separated into two categories: translated properties and untranslated properties.
A contributor may wish to focus on translating the labels or a particular set of properties.
WDProp provides an interface to contributors for finding properties that requires translation.

Wikidata is highly evolving.
New properties are being proposed, discussed and created every day.
It is highly difficult to know the latest statistics like the total count of properties, datatypes, supported languages etc. unless contributors make queries on the Wikidata query service.
WDProp makes use of the query service to provide these statistics related to the properties and other relevant information.

WDProp provides the following information:
       Bookmarkable links
       List of supported languages
       Translation statistics of labels, descriptions and aliases of Wikidata properties
       Missing translation statistics: property labels, descriptions and aliases needing translation
       Search properties by their labels (multilingual)
       Compare translation statistics among different languages
       Navigation of properties by their datatypes and their describing properties
       View already translated labels, descriptions and aliases in any supported language
       Translation statistics of property discussion templates
       Support navigation by classes
       Improve search results
       Support search and language parameter in URLs
       Visualize path of translation and provenance information
      
WDProp can be tested on any modern browser. 
         It makes use of the basic web technologies in a manner that anybody can download the set of HTML files and test WDProp in a desktop or a mobile environment.
         It can also be integrated to any server supporting HTML pages.
