  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
     WDProp provides a visual interface to understanding and improving multilingual and collaborative ontology development on Wikidata.  
     Its goal is to understand different aspects of Wikidata properties, particularly focusing on the  translation process.
     Every property has three major information that requires to be translated: label, description and aliases.
     A property may have none, some or all of these information in any given language.
     Properties can be therefore be separated into two categories: translated properties and untranslated properties.
     A contributor may wish to focus on translating the labels or a particular set of properties.
     WDProp provides an interface to contributors for finding properties that requires translation.

     Wikidata is highly evolving.
     New properties are being proposed, discussed and created every day.
     It is highly difficult to know the latest statistics like the total count of properties, datatypes, supported languages etc. unless contributors make queries on the Wikidata query service.
     WDProp makes use of the query service to provide these statistics related to the properties and other relevant information.
